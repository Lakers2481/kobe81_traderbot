## Known Minor Issues

### Display Text (Non-Critical)

**Issue:** Scanner output line 212 displays "KOBE PIPELINE: 900 STOCKS" instead of "800 STOCKS"

**Impact:** Cosmetic only - actual scan was 800 stocks (verified)

**Evidence of Actual 800:**
- Line 10: "Scanning 800 symbols with Dual Strategy"
- Line 135: "Fetched: 800 symbols, skipped: 0"
- All configuration files: Point to 800-stock universe

**Action:** Update display string in scanner code (low priority)

### ML Components (Graceful Degradation)

**Issue:** TensorFlow not available, LSTM using fallback mode

**Impact:** Minimal - Ensemble models (XGBoost + LightGBM) still active and providing ML confidence

**Status:** Non-critical, system designed for graceful degradation

---
