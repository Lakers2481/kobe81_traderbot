    "# Tutorial: A Walkthrough of the Cognitive Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides a hands-on tutorial for understanding how the `kobe81_traderbot`'s advanced cognitive architecture works.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will follow a single trading signal through the entire cognitive workflow:\n",
    "1.  **Signal Creation**: We'll define a sample trading signal and market context.\n",
    "2.  **Cognitive Evaluation**: We'll pass the signal to the `CognitiveSignalProcessor` to be evaluated by the `CognitiveBrain`.\n",
    "3.  **Decision Analysis**: We'll inspect the brain's decision, including its confidence, reasoning, and any concerns.\n",
    "4.  **Learning from Outcome**: We'll simulate a trade outcome and feed it back into the system to complete the learning loop.\n",
    "5.  **Generating Explanations**: We'll use the `explainability` module to generate a human-readable narrative of the entire event."
