    "answer": "Analyzed 13 external resources across finance/trading (4), agent orchestration (2), UI/chat (1), dev/ops (1), learning/reference (2), and unrelated domains (3). HIGH VALUE: FinGPT (sentiment analysis datasets + LoRA fine-tuning), TradeMaster (RL evaluation harness PRUDEX-Compass), Hands-On LLM book (RAG/agent production patterns), agentic-flow (multi-agent orchestration with SONA adaptive learning), ML System Design Case Studies (300+ production ML architectures from Netflix/Airbnb/Meta). MEDIUM VALUE: NextChat (multi-LLM UI for user interaction), Lissy93 dotfiles (CI/CD automation patterns), hello-algo (educational reference only). LOW VALUE: Everywhere (desktop AI assistant - wrong domain), tobor_v00 (robotics hardware - unrelated), IrScrutinizer (infrared signal processing - unrelated), arXiv 2504.17033 (theoretical graph algorithms - no practical trading application). CRITICAL GAPS ADDRESSED: FinGPT provides real sentiment scoring (fixes alt-data dummy defaults), TradeMaster provides RL evaluation harness (validates current RL agent), agentic-flow provides production-grade agent orchestration (fixes advisory brain override issue), ML case studies provide architectural patterns for risk gates enforcement and data pipeline integrity.",

  "contradictions": [
    "FinGPT claims better performance than GPT-4/ChatGPT on sentiment tasks but only on their specific datasets (News/Tweets) - not independently verified on financial forecasting",
    "TradeMaster provides 15+ RL algorithms but their PRUDEX-Compass benchmark doesn't specify transaction costs or slippage models - may not reflect real trading conditions",
    "agentic-flow claims 60% cost savings via LLM router but doesn't specify baseline comparison or latency impact - unclear if suitable for real-time trading decisions"
  ],
  "gaps": [
    "FinGPT: No clear integration path for real-time sentiment scoring; models are batch fine-tuned, not online learning",
    "TradeMaster: Evaluation harness PRUDEX-Compass may not include regime-specific backtesting (bull/bear/chop)",
    "Hands-On LLM: Book examples use LangChain which adds dependency overhead; no financial-specific RAG examples",
    "agentic-flow: SONA adaptive learning is in alpha - production stability unknown; no financial domain examples",
    "ML Case Studies: Curated list lacks specific position sizing or risk management architectures for trading systems",
    "All resources: None address the specific problem of 'enriched data lost before order execution' - this is a Kobe-specific state management issue",
    "All resources: None provide patterns for 'risk gates that log but don't block' - enforcement vs advisory distinction missing"
