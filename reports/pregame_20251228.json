While our system flags a 90% confidence BULLISH regime with SPY comfortably above its 200-day SMA at $625.03, the underlying regime probabilities tell a more nuanced story - we're essentially in a three-way tie with BULL at 33%, NEUTRAL at 34%, and BEAR at 33%. This near-equilibrium suggests we're at a regime transition point, which historically creates both opportunity and whipsaw risk.\n\nThe fact that we're Day 0 in the current regime is significant. Fresh regime changes, especially when probabilities are this balanced, tend to see increased volatility as the market tests conviction. With SPY above its 200-day, the structural bias remains bullish, but I'm treating this as a \"prove it\" day where the market needs to demonstrate follow-through on any directional moves.",
  "market_mood_description": "The neutral mood score of 0.00 combined with VIX at 20.0 presents a deceptively calm surface. While VIX isn't flagged as extreme, 20.0 sits right at the historical average, suggesting markets are pricing in normal uncertainty rather than complacency or panic. This neutral positioning often precedes meaningful moves in either direction, as there's no strong emotional bias to fade.\n\nThe absence of extreme readings means we won't get the typical contrarian signals today. Instead, I'm focused on momentum and technical breakouts, as neutral sentiment can quickly shift once price action establishes a clear direction.",
  "overnight_news_summary": "The overnight news flow carries two key undercurrents worth monitoring. The AI bubble discussion and S&P concentration concerns could weigh on mega-cap tech if investors begin questioning valuations, while the Ukraine-related headlines introduce geopolitical uncertainty that typically benefits safe havens and pressures risk assets. The aggregate sentiment of 0.00 suggests these cross-currents are largely offsetting each other for now.\n\nSilver's continued surge amid supply concerns deserves attention as a potential inflation hedge trade, while any concrete developments on Ukraine ceasefire prospects could trigger risk-on rotations. I'm watching for sector rotation signals, particularly any tech weakness that might benefit value sectors or defensive plays.",

    "executive_summary": "PLTR presents a compelling long opportunity at $188.71 with an IBS_RSI signal score of 11.1, targeting a 2:1 risk/reward setup in a confirmed bull market regime (91% confidence). The strategy's 65% win rate in bull markets significantly exceeds the base 50.3% rate, while PLTR's position $39.54 above its 200-day SMA ($149.17) confirms strong underlying momentum despite being 9.1% off 52-week highs.",
    "why_this_trade": "The signal score of 11.1 represents an exceptionally strong setup - while specific benchmarks aren't provided, this suggests multiple confluence factors aligning simultaneously. PLTR's current positioning offers optimal entry conditions: trading $5.56 above the 20-day SMA ($183.15) and $7.60 above the 50-day SMA ($181.11), indicating sustained bullish momentum without being overextended.\n\nThe IBS_RSI strategy specifically targets mean-reversion opportunities within trending markets. PLTR's RSI of 57.1 sits in the neutral-to-bullish zone, avoiding overbought conditions while maintaining upward bias. The stock's 197.6% distance from 52-week lows versus only 9.1% from highs suggests substantial room for continued appreciation.",
    "historical_edge_analysis": "## 10. KEY LEVELS TO WATCH\n\n- **Entry Trigger Level:** $188.71 (current market price)\n- **Stop Loss Level:** $173.75 (7.9% downside protection, below key support)\n- **First Profit Target:** $195.37 (nearest resistance, 3.5% upside)\n- **Second Profit Target",
    "technical_analysis": "",
    "news_impact_analysis": "- **Market Regime Fit: 90** - Bull market classification with 91% confidence strongly favors strategy performance",
    "risk_analysis": "**Trail Stop Strategy:** Once price exceeds $195.37, trail stop to breakeven ($188.71). If reaching $196.35, trail to $190.00 to lock in profits while allowing for extended moves toward the full target.",
    "execution_plan": "**Entry Strategy:** Execute market order at current levels ($188.71) given the strong signal score of 11.1. The 5.2-day average hold period suggests timing precision is less critical than signal capture.\n\n**Order Types:** Use stop-loss order at $173.75 to ensure automatic exit if invalidated. Consider bracket order combining entry and protective stop simultaneously.",
    "position_sizing": "**Recommended Allocation:** Maximum 2% of portfolio given the 7.9% stop distance and high volatility environment. This limits maximum loss to 0.16% of total capital ($14.96 \u00d7 2% = $0.30 per $100 invested).\n\n**Dollar Risk:** At 100 shares, maximum loss equals $1,496 at the stop level. Scale position size based on portfolio risk tolerance, maintaining the 2% maximum allocation regardless of account size.\n\n**Risk/Reward Analysis:** Current 2:1 ratio provides attractive asymmetric payoff, requiring only 33.3% win rate for breakeven versus the strategy's 65% bull market performance.\n\n## 9.
