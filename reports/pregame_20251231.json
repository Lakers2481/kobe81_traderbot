  "regime_analysis": "We're entering the session with maximum uncertainty - a perfect three-way split at 33-34% across all regime probabilities with only 50% confidence in our current NEUTRAL classification. This is day zero of the regime, meaning we just transitioned, which historically creates choppy, direction-seeking price action. The fact that SPY remains above its 200-day SMA at $626.34 provides some structural support, but with regime probabilities this evenly distributed, I'm not banking on any sustained directional moves today.\n\nThis regime uncertainty typically manifests as false breakouts, whipsaws, and elevated intraday volatility despite the VIX sitting at a manageable 20.0. When our models can't distinguish between bull, neutral, and bear scenarios with any conviction, it's telling us the market is at an inflection point. We need to trade defensively until we get clearer regime confirmation over the next 2-3 sessions.",
  "market_mood_description": "The neutral mood score of 0.00 combined with VIX at 20.0 (non-extreme) suggests we're in a \"wait and see\" environment rather than panic or euphoria. This is actually constructive - it means any moves today will likely be driven by fundamentals or technical levels rather than emotion. However, the lack of strong directional bias also means lower probability of sustained trends, favoring mean-reversion strategies over momentum plays.\n\nWith VIX below 25 but above 15, we're in that middle zone where options aren't screaming cheap but also aren't prohibitively expensive. This gives us flexibility in structure choice but requires more precision in timing and strike selection.",
  "overnight_news_summary": "The overnight sentiment of -0.30 reflects mixed signals, but the jobless claims data provides a bright spot - initial claims at 199K versus 219K estimate shows labor market resilience, while continuing claims dropped to 1,866K from 1,913K prior. This supports the \"soft landing\" narrative and should provide some underlying bid to equities, particularly consumer discretionary and financials.\n\nHowever, the China tariff news on beef imports and pharmaceutical pricing concerns create sector-specific headwinds. Healthcare could see pressure from the drug pricing headlines, while the beef tariffs add another layer to trade tensions. These are more medium-term concerns than immediate market movers, but they contribute to the cautious undertone reflected in futures being down despite positive employment data.",

    "why_this_trade": "**Exceptional Setup Characteristics:** JPM's current positioning represents a confluence of technical strength and strategic opportunity. The stock sits just -2.2% from its 52-week high while maintaining $38.30 (13.4%) cushion above the 200-day SMA at $285.12, indicating robust long-term trend integrity. The 7.8 signal score places this setup in the upper quartile of IBS_RSI signals, suggesting above-average probability of success.\n\n**Signal Quality vs. Historical Norms:** With 15,496 historical trades generating a 50.3% win rate, the IBS_RSI strategy demonstrates consistent edge extraction. The 7.8 signal score significantly exceeds the median, as evidenced by the strategy's ability to maintain a 1.08 profit factor despite the inherent noise in mean-reversion approaches. This score suggests technical conditions align favorably with historical winning patterns.\n\n**JPM-Specific Advantages:** As a large-cap financial with $5.53 ATR (1.7% of price), JPM offers institutional-grade liquidity while maintaining sufficient volatility for meaningful profit capture. The current volume at 80% of 20-day average indicates controlled, non-panicked price action, creating optimal conditions for systematic entry.\n\n**Confluence Factors:** The convergence of price momentum (STRONG_UP trend), technical positioning ($6.07 above 20-day SMA), and regime-appropriate performance (60% win rate in NEUTRAL markets) creates a multi-dimensional edge rarely seen in isolation.",

KEY LEVELS TO WATCH\n\n- **Entry Trigger:** $323.42 (current market price)\n- **Stop Loss:** $311.39 (3.7% risk, 2.18x ATR buffer)\n- **First Profit Target:** $335.00 (near $330.86 resistance)\n- **Second Profit Target:** $347.48 (full 2:1 risk/reward)\n- **Invalidation Level:** Break below $306.80 support invalidates setup",
    "risk_analysis": "",
    "execution_plan": "**Entry Timing:** Execute immediately at market open using limit order at $323.50 or better to avoid slippage. Given 80% volume levels, market impact should be minimal for institutional-sized positions.\n\n**Order Structure:** Use stop-limit order for stop loss at $311.39 with limit price at $311.00 to prevent gap-down execution below intended level.\n\n**Profit Management:** Take 50% position off at $335.00 (first resistance approach), remaining 50% at $347.48 (full 2:1 target). Trail stop to breakeven after first profit take.\n\n**Timeline Expectations:** Based on 5.2-day average hold period, expect resolution within 3-7 trading days.",
    "position_sizing": "**Portfolio Allocation:** Recommend 2.5% portfolio allocation, balancing the 7.8 signal score strength against recent setup performance deterioration.\n\n**Risk Calculation:** With $12.03 stop loss distance, maximum portfolio risk equals 0.925% (2.5% × 3.7%), well within institutional risk management parameters.\n\n**Reward Potential:** Target $24.06 upside represents 7.4% gain potential, creating 18.5 basis points portfolio contribution at full target achievement.\n\n## 9.
