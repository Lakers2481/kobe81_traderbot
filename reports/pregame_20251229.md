## Market Context
- **Regime:** BULLISH (90% confidence)
- **Mood:** Neutral (VIX: 20.0)
- **Trading Bias:** DEFENSIVE

## Regime Analysis
Good morning team. We're seeing a fascinating regime transition developing here. Our system just flipped to BULLISH with 90% confidence, but this is day zero of the new regime - essentially we're catching this shift in real time. What's particularly interesting is the underlying regime probabilities are essentially a three-way tie at 33-34% each, suggesting we're in a highly uncertain transitional period despite the bullish signal. The fact that SPY is trading above the 200-day SMA at $625.03 provides the technical foundation for this bullish call, but I want everyone aware we're operating with elevated regime uncertainty.

This setup reminds me of those inflection points where the market is deciding its next major move. The 90% confidence on the bullish regime suggests strong momentum factors are aligning, but the balanced underlying probabilities tell us this could reverse quickly if we don't get follow-through. I'm treating this as a "prove it" bullish setup rather than a confirmed trend.

## Market Mood
The mood metrics are painting a picture of studied neutrality that I find tactically useful. VIX at 20.0 with a perfectly neutral sentiment score of 0.00 suggests we're in that sweet spot where fear and greed are balanced - no extreme emotions driving poor decision-making from the broader market. This isn't the kind of low-VIX complacency that makes me nervous, nor is it the high-VIX panic that creates opportunities but requires defensive positioning.

This neutral mood state actually supports our fresh bullish regime signal. We're not fighting against extreme positioning or sentiment, which means if positive catalysts emerge, we should see cleaner price action without the whipsaws that come from extreme sentiment unwinds.

## News Summary
The overnight news flow is remarkably balanced with zero aggregate sentiment - exactly matching our mood readings. The geopolitical headlines around Trump's Ukraine-Russia deal discussions could be a positive catalyst if progress materializes, particularly for European markets and defense-related names. However, I'm noting this is still in the "getting closer" phase rather than concrete developments.

The AI bubble discussion in the headlines is worth monitoring - any rotation away from mega-cap tech could benefit our broader market bullish thesis if money flows into value and cyclicals. The mixed futures action (Dow up, S&P and Nasdaq down) suggests some of this rotation may already be underway, which could actually strengthen a broader bullish regime by reducing concentration risk.

## Top-3 Picks

### 1. PLTR (IBS_RSI)
- Side: long
- Entry: $188.71
- Stop: $173.75

## Trade of the Day
**PLTR** (IBS_RSI)

The signal score of 11.1 represents an exceptionally strong setup - while specific benchmarks aren't provided, this suggests multiple confluence factors aligning simultaneously. PLTR's current positioning offers optimal entry conditions: trading $5.56 above the 20-day SMA ($183.15) and $7.60 above the 50-day SMA ($181.11), indicating sustained bullish momentum without being overextended.

The IBS_RSI strategy specifically targets mean-reversion opportunities within trending markets. PLTR's RSI of 57.1 sits in the neutral-to-bullish zone, avoiding overbought conditions while maintaining upward bias. The stock's 197.6% distance from 52-week lows versus only 9.1% from highs suggests substantial room for continued appreciation.
