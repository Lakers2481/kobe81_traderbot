FINDINGS SUMMARY:
=================

SEV-0 (CRITICAL): 0 issues
SEV-1 (FIX BEFORE TOMORROW): 3 issues
1. Dividend adjustments not tracked
2. ML confidence defaults to 0.5 (needs verification)
3. DataQuorum not wired into production

SEV-2 (FIX SOON): 4 issues
1. Cache hash verification missing
2. Corporate actions registry empty
3. ML training CV not verified
4. Weekend preview mode not flagged

VERIFIED CORRECT:
=================
✓ Data provenance traceable to approved sources
✓ Data quality: 99.4% coverage, 0 OHLC violations
✓ Lookahead prevention: .shift(1) mathematically proven
✓ Position sizing: Dual-cap (2% risk + 20% notional) verified
✓ Indicator math: RSI, ATR, IBS calculations correct
✓ Timezone handling: Consistent naive datetime (America/New_York)

NEXT STEPS:
===========

BEFORE PAPER TRADING:
1. Verify ML confidence is real (not default 0.5)
2. Wire DataQuorum into scan.py

BEFORE LIVE TRADING:
1. Fix all SEV-1 issues
2. Build dividend exclusion filter
3. Audit ML model training for leakage

DAILY OPERATIONS:
=================
See: RUNBOOKS/DATA_MATH_DAILY_CHECKLIST.md (5 min/day)
